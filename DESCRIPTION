Description: 'Tautulli' (<http://tautulli.com>) is a monitoring
    application for 'Plex' Media Servers (<https://www.plex.tv>) which
    collects a lot of data about media items and server usage such as play
    counts. This package interacts with the 'Tautulli' API of any
    specified server to get said data into R. The 'Tautulli' API
    documentation is available at
    <https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/blob/master/API.md>.
