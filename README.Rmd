# tauturri

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/jemus42/tauturri.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jemus42/tauturri)
[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/jemus42/tauturri/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/jemus42/tauturri?branch=master)


The goal of `tauturri` is to get data out of [**Tautulli**](https://github.com/JonnyWong16/plexpy) (formerly **PlexPy**) as simply as possible.

The project is in the initial setup phase. Nothing works yet.

## Server Info

```{r}
info <- get_servers_info()
names(info)
# Probably shouldn't show URL etc.
info[c("name", "version")]
```


## `get_plays_by`

```{r}
plays <- get_plays_by_date()

plays %>% 
  gather(category, playcount, tv, movies, music) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = date, y = playcount, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(title = "Plex Plays by Date",
       subtitle = "Showing Movie, TV and Music Categories",
       x = "Date", y = "Plays", fill = "Category") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```
